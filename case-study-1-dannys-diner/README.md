# 🍜 Case Study #1: Danny's Diner

Welcome to the first case study of the [8-Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/)!

This case focuses on a small restaurant called **Danny’s Diner**, where the owner wants to better understand customer behaviors and optimize loyalty strategies through SQL-based data analysis.

---

## 🧾 Case Overview

Danny wants to use his sales data to answer business questions such as:

- Who are the most valuable customers?
- What do customers typically order?
- How effective is the loyalty program?

---

## 🗃️ Dataset

There are **three tables** in this case study:

| Table      | Description                         |
|------------|-------------------------------------|
| `sales`    | Transaction records per customer    |
| `menu`     | Item names and prices               |
| `members`  | Customer loyalty membership details |

## 🧠 Business Questions

The following business questions are answered using SQL:

1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?
6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
9. If each $1 spent = 10 points and sushi earns 2x points, how many points would each customer have?
10. In the first week after a customer joins, they earn 2x points on all items — how many points would customer A and B have at the end of January?
